      PopSift tries to stick as closely as possible to David Lowe's famous paper, while extracting features from an image in real-time at least on an NVidia GTX 980 Ti GPU.
      David Lowe's famous paper: (Lowe, D. G. (2004). Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints. International Journal of Computer Vision, 60(2), 91â€“110. doi:10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94).
